Simulation of parking station, where cars can arrive, depart and you can check current state of the parking place.
Also I added some auto-tests via AssertJ library. Application following MVC architecture.

Current plans are: 
- refactoring with Spring Framework
- adding real DB as a data storage for cars

Branches:
master - console version (completed)
spring - web version (in progress)
